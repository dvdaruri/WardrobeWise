# WardrobeWise
A Digital Closet App

  For many people today, our closets are overflowing with clothes we have forgotten about, are worn out, or will otherwise never wear again. We propose an app that will help a user keep track of all these clothes and identify which items (through a “cost-per-wear” calculation) the user has gotten their money’s worth for and which clothes they should try to dig out of the closet and wear some more. Users will keep an inventory of the clothing in their closet and track various attributes of each article of clothing they own such as date of acquisition, where it was purchased from, price, and more. On a daily basis, the app will prompt the user to log what they wore on that day. With this information, the user will be able to keep track of what they typically wear together, the cost-per-wear of each item, and the average cost of the outfits the user wears on a daily basis. In other words, we will help users better understand their fashion habits and spending.

	The target audience for this product is sustainability focused consumers ranging from gender, culture, and buying patterns. The purpose is to allow consumers to track the usage rate of their clothing inventory given the original prices. Thus, the project's intended audience is much broader than college students, encompassing people of various backgrounds, ages, and lifestyles who share an interest in sustainability. By tailoring the product to sustainability-focused consumers, the aim is to enable individuals who prioritize environmentally conscious choices to calculate their purchasing decisions. Ultimately, the goal is to allow users to make informed choices about their clothing consumption, promoting a sustainable and mindful approach to fashion that goes beyond any specific demographic group.
